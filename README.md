# Worldwide-Covid-19-Case-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-NumPy-and-Pandas
Worldwide corona virus cases were analyzed using different libraries like 'NumPy' and 'Pandas'. For visualization, 'Matplotlib' and 'Seaborn' libraries were used 
along with many other packages. 

### Two important libraries that were used for this project are: "Folium" and "Plotly"
"Folium" is used for <b>Map Visualization. It used to plot graphs on Canvas</b> <br>
"Plotly" is used for <b>Dynamic Plotting. It makes all the plots and graphs super Interactive.</b>

*Some visualizations are added below. For the best experience, it's recommended to open the .ipynb file in jupyter notebook or any other similar notebooks, as most of the graphs and plots are dynamic, so users can interact with it.*

#### The dataset was collected from the following github repo: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19
After downloading the data from the above link, the data was cleaned and preprocessed.
The following CSV files were used to do this Covid-19 Case analysis:
1. country_daywise.csv
2. countrywise.csv
3. covid_19_data_cleaned.csv
4. daywise.csv

*covid_19_data_cleaned.csv* file has day wise report of all the countries around the world. It has the Latitude and Longitude of all the covid affected nation. This CSV file also has daily 'active', 'recovered', 'confirmed' and 'death' cases worldwide. 

##### The pre-processed datasets were last updated on 24th May, 2021.
